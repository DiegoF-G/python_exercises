# pythonExercises
Only my python training, my playground. From a python course of [Curso em Video](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/curso/python-3-mundo-3/).
In this repository, contains python files (and a package with modules and anothers packages) of each exercise that I did. 
I used the Pycharm IDE to program the contents of these files.
Obs: I used camel case as the default variable and object names instead of sneak case, as is often.

## Summary of files
1. python0-python34: print, input, strings (f-strings, string methods and functions etc), int/floats (arithmetic operators), conditional (if else etc) and modules
2. python35-python70: More of conditional (if elif) and loops (for and while etc)
3. python71-python113: Composite data structures (tuples, lists and dictionarys with yours methods and functions), functions, modularizations and error handling (try except etc)
4. I will also add extra files beyond Curso em Video files
